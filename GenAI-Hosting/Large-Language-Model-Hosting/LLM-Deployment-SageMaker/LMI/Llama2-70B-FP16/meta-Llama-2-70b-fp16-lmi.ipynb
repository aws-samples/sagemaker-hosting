    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a LLama2 large language model with FP16 precision on SageMaker using the DeepSpeed. We use DJLServing as the model serving solution in this example that is bundled in the LMI container. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent blog post (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-bloom-176b-and-opt-30b-on-amazon-sagemaker-with-large-model-inference-deep-learning-containers-and-deepspeed/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Model parallelism can help deploy large models that would normally be too large for a single GPU. With model parallelism, we partition and distribute a model across multiple GPUs. Each GPU holds a different part of the model, resolving the memory capacity issue for the largest deep learning models with billions of parameters. This notebook uses tensor parallelism techniques which allow GPUs to work simultaneously on the same layer of a model and achieve low latency inference relative to a pipeline parallel solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker has rolled out DeepSpeed container which now provides users with the ability to leverage the managed serving capabilities and help to provide the un-differentiated heavy lifting.\n",

    "Summarize the text. In 1766, Peter Kalm published a description of the turtle in his journal Travels into North America.\\\\nThe diamondback terrapin was designated the official state reptile of Maryland in 1994.\\\\nThe diamondback terrapin is the only North American turtle that lives exclusively in brackish water.\\\\nThe diamondback terrapin is the only turtle in the United States that lives exclusively in brackish water. This means that they are able to live in water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as sea water. Diamondback terrapins live in tidal creeks, salt marshes, and shallow areas of bays.\\\\nThe diamondback terrapin is the only North American turtle that lives exclusively in brackish water. Brackish water is a mixture of fresh and salt water, which is found in estuaries and other coastal areas. The diamondback terrapin is well-adapted to this environment, with a salt-tolerant kidney that allows it to drink seawater.\\\\nThe diamondback terrapin is a medium-sized turtle, reaching a maximum length of about 9 inches (23 cm). It has a flattened, oval-shaped shell, which is usually dark brown or black in color. The upper shell (carapace) is covered with a distinctive pattern of diamond-shaped markings, hence the name \\\\u201cdiamondback.\\\\u201d The lower shell (plastron) is usually plain white or cream-colored.\\\\nDiamondback terrapins are found along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Texas. They are also found in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. In the United States, they are most common in the Chesapeake Bay region.\\\\nDiet: Diamondback terrapins are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plants and animals. Their diet includes crabs, snails, clams, worms, and aquatic plants.\\\\nReproduction: Diamondback terrapins mate in the springtime. Females lay their eggs in nests dug into the sandy banks of tidal creeks. The eggs hatch in the fall, and the hatchlings make their way to the water\\\\u2019s edge where they live until they are large enough to fend for themselves.\\\\nThreats: Diamondback terrapins are threatened by a variety of human activities. Habitat destruction and degradation, pollution, and over-collection for food and the pet trade are all major threats to this species.\\\\nConservation: Diamondback terrapins are protected by a number of state and federal laws. In some states, they are also listed as a threatened or endangered species.\\\\nQ: What is the diamondback terrapin\\\\u2019s scientific name?\\\\nA: The diamondback terrapin\\\\u2019s scientific name is Malaclemys terrapin.\\\\nQ: Where does the diamondback terrapin live?\\\\nA: The diamondback terrapin is found along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Texas.

    "Summarize this. Robin Hood is England's best-loved outlaw. Robin Hood's good traits are easily seen throughout the story. The author did a good job of making his hero come across as a good person, who has often been misinterpreted because of things that he did as a young boy. Showing the change Robin Hood has made since he was a little boy easily allows the reader to better understand how great he really is, and how he is helping not only himself, but all of the poorer community.Robin Hood was faced with issues from very early on in his life. His mothers death was very difficult for him, but living with his fathers love for another women, after his mother had died, was just too much for him and he threatened his father that staying with that women would cost him his only sons love. Robin then left for many years, only to come back and discover that his father had been murdered and that the new leader of Nottingham was the Sheriff. Not only was this a great shock to Robin, but all the people of the land were suffering greatly from the Sheriffs corrupt rule. He was very money hungry and greedy, and the lower class community suffered greatly from his greediness. Robin Hood had many different traits that are quite obvious in the story and the movie. For one he is very set on taking from the wealth of Nottingham and giving back to the poorer community so they can live well. His main idea here is to get as much taken from the Sheriff of Nottingham and his sympathizers so they can easily attack and take the kingdom back. In the end his plan works and Robin kills the Sheriff and the Kingdom is once again his, as well as Maid Marion. His goals are reached because he is persistent in what he wants, and will stop at nothing to get back all the things that the people had lost, and all the things he had lost. Robin Hood seemed almost charismatic in some ways in the story and the movie, however it doesn't seem that he tried to be.\n",
